"# MetaMind: Deep Learning Framework for Image Classification

MetaMind is a Python-based deep learning framework specifically designed for image classification tasks. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into different categories.

## Features

- **Flexible CNN Architecture**: MetaMind allows users to define and customize the architecture of their CNN models, including the number and type of layers, activation functions, and regularization techniques.
- **Efficient Training**: The framework supports efficient training of CNN models using popular optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive moment estimation (Adam).
- **Image Augmentation**: MetaMind provides built-in image augmentation capabilities to expand the training dataset and improve the generalization of the trained models.
- **Transfer Learning**: Users can leverage pre-trained CNN models from popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch and fine-tune them for their specific image classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: The framework includes functions for evaluating the performance of trained models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Save and Load Models**: Trained models can be saved and loaded for future use, allowing seamless integration into deployment pipelines.
